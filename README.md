## Description
**Fight For Universe: Final Expedition** is a mod that extends original **Stationeers** in many different ways.

## Features
**Experimental Placement Mode**: 
 - Intended to make items placeable on surfaces that normally don't allow placement. 
 - Turning on SCROLL LOCK key will enable experimental placement mode. Don't forget to turn it off.
 - Clicking "PrecisionPlace" key while placing object will allow you to re-align item to the surface.

**Vending Machine Inventory**:
 - While holding any SHIFT key, interact with arrows to access simplified inventory list.
 - While any SHIFT key is held, vending machine will also show number of occupied storage slots.
 - (Planned) Will sort stored items so you won't have to look for strays (i.e. all cables will be one after another).
 - Simplified inventory list will switch only to the first available slot with chosen item.

**Reworked Hash Generator (Disabled)**:
 - Fixed search list, where now everything is sorted properly, when you searching for items.
 - No longer requires screwdriver to access item list and select something.
 - Screwdriver is only required, when you want to adjust search list to any production facility on the network.
